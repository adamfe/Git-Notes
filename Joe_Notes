Joe Notes
- HEAD, index (cache, staging), working tree
- HEAD is the commit that you are on
- HEAD points to where you are in a given branch (ex: second commit, the history, another branch)
- Index, which is sometimes called cache or staging). All commits pass through the index before they make it into the repository. It's a staging ground so to speak.
